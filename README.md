Title: Decision Making in C++
In programming, decision making allows a program to choose different paths based on conditions. It's similar to how we take decisions in daily life — for example, “If it's raining, take an umbrella. Otherwise, don't.”

C++ provides several decision control structures that help implement logic in programs. These include if, if-else, else-if, nested conditions, and switch-case. These constructs make programs smarter by allowing them to respond differently to different inputs or situations.

Types of Decision Making in C++
1. if Statement
Executes a block of code only if a given condition is true.

2. if-else Statement
Runs one block if the condition is true, and another if it's false.

3. else-if Ladder
Used when multiple conditions need to be checked one after another.

4. Nested if
An if condition inside another if. Used when one condition depends on another.

5. switch-case
Best for fixed options (like menu choices or operator-based programs). Compares a variable with several constant cases and executes the matching one.

Program on decision making
1. Even or Odd Checker
Checks if a number is divisible by 2. Uses the modulus operator and if-else condition to determine and display whether the number is even or odd.

Sample Output:
Enter the number: 78
The given number is even number.

2. Vowel or Consonant Identifier
Accepts a character input and checks whether it's a vowel using either if-else or a switch case. If not a vowel, it’s treated as a consonant.

Sample Output:
Enter a character. p The given character is a consonant.

3. Largest of Three Numbers
Takes three numbers and uses else-if ladder or nested if to compare and determine the largest among them.

Sample Output:
Enter the value of a. 67
Enter the value of b. 89
Enter the value of c. 90
c is the largest number.

4. Simple Calculator
Implements a calculator using a switch statement. Based on the operator entered (+, -, *, /), it performs the respective arithmetic operation.

Sample Output:
Enter an operator (+, -, *, /): /
Enter two numbers: 10 2
10 / 2 = 5

5. Switch case with break statements (food Menu Program)
Menu-driven application using switch-case. Displays a food item based on the user's numeric choice. A default message is shown for invalid selections.

Sample Output:
Welcome to the International Cuisine Menu

Chinese food
Manchurian
Hakka Noodles
Italian food
Spaghetti
Pizza
Indian food
Dosa
Idli
Thai food
Thai special sweet
Thai curry
French food
Macarons
Onion soup
Mexican food
Tacos
Burritos

Sushi
Ramen
Enter your cuisine choice (1 to 7): 4
Enter your dish preference (1 or 2): 2

Cuisine: Thai
Dish: Thai curry

Algorithms
1. Even or Odd Checker
Take input as a number n.
Check if n % 2 == 0.
If true, print “Even”.
Else, print “Odd”.
2. Vowel or Consonant
Take a character input.
Convert it to lowercase (if needed).
If it is a, e, i, o, or u, print “Vowel”.
Else, print “Consonant”.
3. Largest of Three Numbers
Take input: a, b, and c.
If a > b and a > c, print “a is largest”.
Else if b > c, print “b is largest”.
Else, print “c is largest”.
Conclusion
Decision-making statements are the backbone of logical flow in C++ programs. Whether it's a basic check using if, evaluating multiple paths using else-if, or using switch for cleaner alternatives, these tools make your programs flexible and responsive. The examples shared cover common scenarios and form a strong foundation for real-world programming logic.
